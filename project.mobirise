We are the generation that was told by everyone that engineers, accountants and the likes were in high demand and that if we ventured into those careers, jobs and money would be in abundance! What a scam! The sight of graduates standing at street corners, begging for jobs, has become normalised. The countless doors that the “key of education” has failed to unlock has left many of us questioning the legitimacy of our academic success and the prospects of the future.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><div>\n</div><div>Born in the 90’s, at the brink of independence, with seemingly infinite possibilities in sight, the future had never looked any brighter for black South Africans. In comparison to the generation that came before us, we had, and still have, access to more opportunities and better education than what our predecessors could have ever imagined. With all of this access, opportunity and education, we find ourselves looking back and questioning the effectiveness thereof.</div><div><br></div><div> \n</div><div>\n</div><div>How is it that life in the promised land feels so unbearable and worse? Surely, this is surprising, even to our parents and grandparents.</div><div><br></div><div> \n</div><div>\n</div><div>For example, my mother, at my age, had already had several years of “work-experience” and was pretty chuffed with her ability to earn a bit of money, especially as an independent woman of her time. In comparison to today's generation, she earned much less and could only afford basic things; nonetheless, she and many others like her were not as depressed and sunless as the 20-something year-old living in our time with an equivalent income. For the 20-something year-old of today, that type of work would be the prime example of \"the failure of the youth to progress and to be emancipated from the shackles of this unjust economy.\" It would be the prime feature of worker-exploitation and the classic scene of the economic inequality of South Africa.</div><div><br></div><div>   \n</div><div>\n</div><div>But how are we this depressed, when our predecessors have gone through “the most”?\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>Expectation, that’s what it is.</div><div><br></div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>The previous generations expected less from life, especially amongst those who were classified as natives. And so, my mother’s low-income job in retail  was actually <b><i>not that bad</i></b>. The fact that our fathers and uncles did not own any cars or properties in their 20’s did not matter at all! \n</div><div>Today, the expectations are high. Your inability to afford a car, for example, in your 20’s is seen as your failure and causes feelings of depression and non-achievement. This is despite the unemployment rate in South Africa sitting at over 27% and over 38% amongst the youth in the third quarter of 2018. Well, according to Stats SA, the “youth” is classified as people between the ages 15 to 34. I don’t recall my 15-year-old-self languishing in unemployment. I didn’t have a job, of course, I was in school! But; anyway, this is how the statistics experts have chosen to present the information regarding unemployment and perhaps begs for a different discussion in a different article.</div><div><br></div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Living in a country that has the youth in its majority, we are the “target market” of election campaigns. Ask the EFF. It is relatively easy for politicians to preach a rhetoric that would sound more attractive to desperate young people. We are desperate and tired - we are thus likely to go for whoever can offer more immediate “solutions.” We have grown impatient - not angry - impatient. As superficial as it may sound, time is running out for us - we just want to have those jobs, own those cars, and live in those properties. It is a blatantly generalised statement, I know, but that’s how it is. The sluggish progress of our lives is what’s keeping us depressed. Sort that out and we will give you our votes. \n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>With that said, this platform will be the portal for young voices of this country. We will say what we think - we will own the conversation - from the youth, by the youth. Because, well, this is what we think. </div><div><br></div><div>We are open to receiving your contribution.

          "text": "<p>6 November 2018 - Jimmy Ramokgopa</p><p><br></p><p>The Democratic Alliance [DA] is the official opposition party of South Africa and has been showing signs of growth since 1994. The DA received 22.2% of the votes in the National Assembly elections in 2014, and 26.9% in the 2016 local government elections (Democratic Alliance, 2018, 03 November 2018, https://www.da.org.za/why-the-da) and the assumption is that it is now becoming more attractive to metropolitan black people.  Despite the growing popularity amongst black people, the DA is often labelled a “white party”. Furthermore, despite their efforts to recruit and place “people of colour” in leadership positions, the general South African population remains unconvinced, especially after numerous racial issues within the party. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>The DA’s racial woes were recently reignited by mme Helen Zille’s controversial tweets about “the legacy of colonialism”. In her argument, the legacy of colonialism, not colonialism, the legacy thereof, is commendable, considering the scale of infrastructural development that has taken place in South Africa. She defiantly argued her point in this regard, despite the DA leader abuti Mmusi Maimane showing disapproval and disagreement. The South African black community observed how abuti Mmusi Maimane attempted to exercise his “power” as the leader, which seemed to lack potency against mme Helen Zille; and, it was at that point where many South Africans came to the conclusion that, even though there are black “leaders” in the DA, the party remains “white” and “white-controlled”, based on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of black people to exercise their so-called “power” within the organisation.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Perhaps, in another article, we shall discuss the problematic nature of mme Helen Zille’s tweets; but, for now, allow me to present the following analogy: if, for instance, I were to intentionally infect you with a certain virus, and after some time of being subjected to pain and suffering due to that virus, I develop an antidote that would cure or make you feel better, it would be rather “sociopath-ish” of me to praise myself for developing the antidote, when it was I who caused the pain and suffering in the first place. Similarly, colonialism caused poverty in Africa. How? Well, the introduction of restrictive borders, pollution and the looting of African resources disrupted Africa’s “natural economy” and the African ways of survival. Because of this, it is disingenuous to praise anything that has to do with colonialism or its legacy, especially as a white South African. To boast about the infrastructure (the “antidote”) that was built on the backs of the colonised is actually quite ridiculously arrogant and shows how “out of touch” some DA leaders are with the realities of the ordinary South African. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>The woes of the DA, in relation to race, did not end there. In April of 2018, there were discussions about how the DA would address issues of transformation within the party, and ultimately, in the spaces where they govern. The real question was whether they were willing to set demographically-based targets in order to have a more equitably diverse setting within the spectrum of the party or not. During their gathering, the use of the country’s demographics as a “guide” was simply rejected. “Diversity” was merely generalised, with no clear targets whatsoever. As per the Democratic Alliances’ Federal Constitution (as amended in April 2018), “The Party solemnly subscribes to the preamble to the Constitution of South Africa which recognizes the injustices of our past, and affirms that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in diversity.  The Party will continue to take active steps to promote and advance diversity in its own ranks”. You’d find it interesting to note that the word “transformation” is nowhere to be found in the DA’s constitution, with no clear indication of how the party plans on distributing access to opportunities and wealth equitably. One of the DA’s core policies, which relates to “fair access to jobs,” is nothing but direct criticism of the ANC government and a promise to do things “better”.There is no mention of equity in relation to the demographics of the country. Perhaps this is the DA’s “liberal” stance, I am not quite sure.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In Europe, perhaps such a “liberal” stance would work; but, in South Africa, where levels of inequality are amongst the highest in the world (with a Gini Index of about 0.7 in 2015), a “liberal” position of this type makes no sense to South Africans. Liberalism, in its basic form and definition, isn’t a bad idea (on paper). It can, however, be used as an instrument of perpetuating the socio-economic status-quo. To ignore the fact that others benefitted unduly and to not do anything to redress the economic injustices is telling of a party’s priorities. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Apartheid might have ended over 20 years ago; however, the systems of apartheid persist still. There might be no visible nor tangible boards or signs with the words “whites only” printed on them, as things were during apartheid, however, certain barriers of entry to certain spaces have demonstrated the ability to be as effective as the actual apartheid “whites only” boards and signs. It seems as though the DA does not understand that <i><b>“equal opportunity” does not necessarily mean “equal access to opportunity.”</b></i> For example, “mobile data” is available to all. Any person, black or white, can have data on their phones, which would allow them to access the internet and to read this article; however, not everyone has access to data. Not everyone can afford it. In this case, “money” or “proximity” is the barrier. So, you see, even though we have equal “opportunity”, we do not have “equal access”. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>In South Africa, fact is, the inequality correlates with race. And so, how can the Democratic Alliance presume that it can address inequality without considering “race”? It makes no sense at all. According to Stats SA’s “Living Conditions of Households in South Africa Report” of 2015, nearly one in every ten (12.39%) of black African-headed households in South Africa earn over R71 478.00 per annum. This means that over 87.61% of black African-headed households earn less than roughly R5 957.00 per month. When looking at the white community, 74.87% of white-headed households earned more than R71 478.00 per annum; and so, of course, the inequality corresponds to race, in South Africa!\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Considering all that is mentioned above, if the Democratic Alliance actively chooses to negate or ignore “race” in their policies, they would actually be acting in a manner that protects the exclusive advantages and interests of white people in South Africa. They would be contributing to the economic underdevelopment of black South Africans. They would be active participants in the intangible systems of apartheid that persist, and by virtue of that, present themselves as agents of a racist political party, or at least, an institutionally racist political party. And if all of the above mentioned in this final paragraph is true, the answer to the above question is: the Democratic Alliance [the DA] <i>is</i> racist. \n</p><p><br></p><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>- Jimmy Ramokgopa (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimmyRamokgopa\" target=\"_blank\">@JimmyRamokgopa</a>)</div><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>16 December 2018 - Nelio Nhacuangue</p><p><br></p><p>Good took social media by storm, with every second person striking fun at the rather unusual name. The satire went from “<i>goodness</i>, not another party, this is <i>bad</i>” to our favorite puppet, Chester Missing, proposing to establish his own political party called “Not Enough”, with the aim of going into coalition with the “Good party” and collectively be dubbed “Not Good Enough”. This chuckled my funny bone to an extent that I forgot the politics of it all… now back to politics and the reason I am penning this article. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Over the years, we have seen a fair share of breakaway parties. For example, COPE, which broke-away from the ANC and led by former ANC bigwigs Mosiuoa Lekota and Mbhazima Shilowa, who did very well for their first election by shaking the ANC hegemony, which was not much, but a shake nonetheless. One could argue that EFF is indeed a breakaway party of the ANC, which campaigned against corruption and putting the interests of “the people” first, particularly the black majority. They became known as “corruption busters” and “land pushers.”\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This was a welcomed relief to the people who felt forgotten, particularly young people who are continually failed by the governing ANC. This fresh-air became surprisingly choking in the past few weeks, with allegations that the EFF, the protectors of the poor, are fingered in the “Great Bank Heist”, a report looking into the looting of almost 2 billion Rand of pension and burial society monies of rural Venda people from VBS Mutual Bank; and, constant links of the party to shady characters like self-confessed smuggler Adriano Mazzotti. And of course, the attack on the media and the denial of any negative reporting that comes the party's way.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>A fall from grace, former corruption busters now nabbed as corruption perpetrators. The Gucci wearing emperor is now walking naked, and sadly, the emperor is somehow oblivious to this fact, as one political analyst [Prince Mashele] sums up the EFF quite interestingly, he says that “The ANC is a university of corruption and the EFF are its graduates”. What COPE and the EFF have in common is the dislike for the ANC. Politics like these often do not have the interest of “the people” at heart. It is effectively factional battles playing themselves out in two different arenas, in this case, different political parties.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Good, a party started by former leader of Independent Democrats and former Mayor\n</p><p>(under the DA) Patricia de Lille, is quite interesting because it doesn't follow the logic of most\n</p><p>breakaway parties. Why do I say that? Patricia de Lille had her own party, the ID, which\n</p><p>dominated the so-called coloured vote in the Western Cape. Motivated by the hunger of power, Patricia de Lille struck a merger deal with the DA which saw the ID being incorporated into the DA, and in exchange, Patricia de Lille would get the mayoral post of Cape Town.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>She has been the mayor for almost 7 years. One of the pillars of her party is to do away with apartheid spatial planning and bring previously disadvantaged people closer to the city center and transportation facilities. This she only realised when things went sour for her in the DA. After her fallout with the DA and the corruption allegations, she cries “racism” within the DA and further states that the DA wants to keep the status quo of ensuring that the city is exclusive to the upper-middle class and the affluent. My question is this: she has been mayor for almost 7 years, what has she done for the poor to be closer to the city? When did she realise that the DA is racist?\n</p><p>\n</p><p>These are the questions that come to mind when listening to her interviews. Why should people trust Patricia de Lille with their votes if she could not advance their interests when she was in power? What will she do differently? Spatial planning is not a new thing and Patricia de Lille has been privy to this fact long before she became mayor and failed to address it adequately. As an observer, Patricia de Lille is trying to punish the DA because they ousted her for corruption allegations and took away her prestigious mayoral chain. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Patricia de Lille wants to cause the DA an upset in the 2019 general elections and wants to ensure that she becomes a member of parliament as this will guarantee her a pay cheque for the next 5 years. I hope Ms de Lille's party doesn't follow a trajectory of all breakaway parties who become close to being irrelevant after participating in their first election. The likes of the NFP (which come from the IFP) and COPE know this very well.\n</p><p><br></p><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>\n</div><div>- Nelio Nhacuangue (@Nelio_five)</div><p></p>",

In this discussion, we noted that there are some black people who live (and have lived) lifestyles that are similar to those of white people, mostly within our generation, at least.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This particular group of black people is often classified as the “black middle class” and is said to be growing. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-measuring-south-africas-black-middle-class/\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Check</a>, in 2017, the New York Times presented claims that the black middle class in South Africa doubled between 1998 and 2008, and “more than doubled” between 2004 and 2013. I and many others argue that the concept of a “black middle class” in South Africa is misleading, because many of these classifications are largely based on <i>average income</i>. It is misleading in the sense that many black individuals who find themselves in that income band have many other responsibilities which their white counterparts do not have. This is popularly referred to as “black tax”. And so, even if the income is similar or is within the classification of “middle class”, such black people are effectively at a lower class due to the debt and responsibilities they have to service before fully “enjoying” the lifestyle of a middle-class person.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Of course, “middle class” is a relative concept, especially when the term is defined differently when in an underdeveloped country compared to a developed one. Therefore, we shall avoid using the term “black middle class” in our discussion, based on some of the discrepancies noted thereof. Instead, we will use the term “Better Blacks”.</p><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>In the analysis and observation, we noticed that there is some form of “privilege” amongst certain black people. But, we could not label them as \"privileged\" because the word is reserved only for our white brothers and sisters, and, rightfully so. Findings from Stats SA’s Living Conditions of Households in South Africa (2014/15) show that “nearly one in every ten (12.39%) black African-based households in South Africa were found to be in the upper income per capita quintile. This means that an overwhelming majority (87.61%) of black African-headed households were earning less than R74 479 per annum” whilst the majority of white-headed households (74.87%) were in the upper quintile and earned over R74 479 per annum.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>Clearly, even though there is a growing number of black people who “live like white people”, we could not call them “privileged”, also because they too experience (to their surprise) racial discrimination within society and the economy. Furthermore <b>privilege is not a bank balance.</b> And even though the concept of a “black middle class” is fundamentally flawed, we know them as the \"cheese boys and girls\" who went to private schools, grew up in the suburbs and could afford to pay for their own varsity fees, despite having and making use of the opportunity to study through a bursary. These are the blacks who were given a \"graduate starter-pack\" and could afford a lifestyle better than others.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>Jessica and I coined the term \"better blacks\" to better describe these individuals. I'm not sure if this is a completely new term, nonetheless, it is something that we have coined. This term describes that middle-to-upper class of black people, who are not necessarily in the same economic and privileged situation as white people, but certainly not in the same economic situation as the majority of black South Africans. With that said, the term [better blacks] should not be used in a completely negative context because it shows that there is some economic improvements within the black community, which is something that should be celebrated, of course.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>&nbsp;However, I argue that “better blacks” should have a different “filter” with regards to the distribution of the country's wealth. There is a real need to ensure that wealth is distributed to all black people, especially those outside of the \"better black\" band. It has become apparent that we are at a stage where we need to modify the “black empowerment” policy. Jessica best described this eloquently by saying that “We've coined the term ‘better blacks’, to highlight that there are various classes in the black community. The elite of our community need to acknowledge their better start in life so that they make the best of it and realise that some of their friends are not on their level.”</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The concept of Better Blacks will be unpacked over a series of articles. As you might have noticed from the title, this is Part 1 of that series. Part 2 will introduce a proposed new policy model for black empowerment.</p><p><br></p><p>- Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)<br></p>",

We are deep in the campaign process and the top 3 parties (ANC, EFF and DA) have shown a consistent lack of real political engagement with its citizens, choosing rather to bash and undermine each other as a way of canvassing for votes. The other strategy is the sudden concern for citizens’ issues and the everyday needs that never get as much attention or priority after elections.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>A lot of the problems faced in South Africa are still distinctively racially marked, due to the legacy of apartheid, despite the 25 years of independence. Our society is the most unequal in the world, in terms of class, race and gender. The journey of creating a democratic, non-racial and non-sexist society seems like a utopia. A distant dream that is too far-fetched to reach. The objectives of the ANC to achieve that goal are commendable, but the path to get there is inadequate. They have failed and now should be the time for them to admit that, because many South Africans are disgruntled and no longer interested in hearing promises that will not be fulfilled.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>South Africans are tired of an unequal society that seems to benefit the few at the expense of the rest. What we need is a party that is able to address the social issues that face the average South African. Issues that still affect South Africans along racial lines, class, gender and social status. Tackling just one of those issues does not mean that we are heading towards right direction and tackling all of them at once will not suffice.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The problem lies with the lack of basic understanding from leaders. An understanding of what a day in South Africa is like for a transgendered person, a woman, a child, a marginalized group of people or a senior citizen. The world is not just black and white, there are different aspects within those barriers, and within those barriers, there are different needs and wants. The best solution is to address these issues one at a time and not all at once, gradually working to improve each issue for each citizen.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The ANC, EFF and DA have all taken different approaches and issues to focus on during this election period. The ANC’s focus is on the older generation, the generation that is ever thankful for the rescuing from the perils of Apartheid. It is a very clever tactic because the older generation tends to stick firm to the “old ways” of thinking and is not keen to change. This has been their strategy for years and has kept them in power for so long. They tend to say the same thing over, just a little bit better each time. The problem with the ANC is that they believe they will always rule South Africa because South Africans are forever indebted to them. The apartheid regime was a terrible crime to humanity and the battle was definitely not won by the ANC alone, there were other driving forces that led to the liberation of South Africa.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The EFF’s strategy, on the other hand, is focusing on the most marginalized and <b>angriest </b>people of South Africa. Considering the fact that youth unemployment rate is at its highest [38,2 %], the youth bear the hardships of a failing economy, inflation, crime and a terrible education system that does not prepare them for the labour force. The EFF uses this emotion by focusing on populist ideas that fuels anger and causes frustration, making the EFF seem like the viable answer to ending those problems. The strategy is that “the people shall govern”, “the people shall decide that the wealth of South Africa should be distributed equally”; “that the land shall be returned to its rightful owners and they shall work it”. They promise to break the barriers of inequality and share the resources of South Africa with the people. Because they provide a promising young leadership, this makes them really attractive.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The EFF is often the voice of the marginalized in tertiary institutions and often decides to incite violence if there is a lack of “compliance”. They tend to use the word “shutdown” for everything when their demands are not met. Shutdown Unisa! Shutdown universities! Shutdown the State of the Nation Address! It’s a shutdown system with no interest in reaching a reasonable middle-ground. The infamous Commander in Chief has won over the hearts of the youth and their voter base seems to be growing.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The DA seems to have a focus on the middle. With their desperation to retrieve a large black vote, they are doing whatever they can to seem as if they are non-racial and that they are all inclusive and want to ensure that everyone has a job. However, there has been some shady dealings that surround the DA, and there is a lot of things unravelling. Racial accusations from former Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, having a “black face” in the forefront whilst an all-male, all-white cabal is running the show in the background, and of course, the infamous billboard bashing the ANC has caused an outrage amongst South Africans.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>Nonetheless, campaigning continues in the midst of this chaos. We also see an overwhelming and troubling effort by all the parties to discredit each other rather than dealing or engaging with the issues. Everyday, some new information made to discredit one of the political parties is revealed and yet no real public engagement exists. Instead, we see popular media and sensationalist tactics that are meant to distract the public form the real issues facing this country. \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>It’s all the same songs sung during every tenure and it’s getting quite boring and annoying to listen to. The sudden show of “concern”, such as that of the EFF disputing the rules set out to prevent students from being able to do walk-ins in universities, the shack door-to-door campaigns where citizens are asked what more can the ANC do to “move South Africa forward together”; or the billboard to show us how “The ANC is killing us” are all mere spectacles and performances. These performances of superficial  interest and party-bashing will not take this country forward. Elections in 2019 will be the one to watch very closely and to observe what change the average South African will make.</p><p><br></p><p>- Praise Mavasa (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tshuxeko8?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">@Tshuxeko8</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>25 April 2019 - The Uhuru Reporter&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>All our problems will be solved when we give the poor money...\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>I have realized in my short time on the Twitter “wokesphere” that there are going to be no easy solutions to the problems we are facing as a nation. The rampant poverty, ever increasing unemployment, highly contrasted by an increase in graduates, and a purported lack of opportunities has presented a very complex economy that not one of our “parties” seems to have a clear path to fixing. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Now, I am, personally, not an economics or a politics expert, but just another concerned citizen at the edge of an election, and I know that it's important to decide who to vote for. There has not been, in my view, a more important election in South Africa post ‘94 when the power was \"restored\", and the democratic voice of ALL could be heard. Alex Borraine said in his book, titled “A country unmasked”, that he thought it would take at least a generation or two to see any real result of the process of Truth, Reconciliation, and healing that was the ‘94 election. Now 25 years later, exactly one generation after Apartheid South Africa, we sit at a point of that very reflection. \n</p><p><br></p><p>There is no better place to take a sneak peek into the “new” South Africa than the “Twitterverse”. Made up almost entirely of the supposedly “woke”, the educated, the businesses, the “influencers”, political figures, celebrities, the “average Thabang”, real and fake news agencies, and not to mention us, the quasi-intellectuals, social activist, political-ideal-pushing, quite often uninformed, with very little to no experience and no real understanding, or real-world-experience political activists. One cannot even question the effectiveness of the platform for “peddling information”, and the fact that such groups of individuals choose the platform is nothing but a point of marvel.  \n</p><p><br></p><p>The question though remains, “How to fix the economy and get the country going again?” And the range of answers offered by the parties is astounding, making it really hard to choose who to vote for. One may consider the ANC but the Twittersphere seems to blame 100% of our problems partly on their “socialist” approach and on the cadreship, tenderprenuership, and corruption that they say is inherently synonymous with the party. The party’s head is also under a lot of scrutinies for being labeled \"the most surprised person in the country\". \n</p><p><br></p><p>This has only birthed the “blame-game, bogeyman, scare tactics, and self-congratulatory\" politics of the DA. The party revels in constantly bouncing between blaming the ANC for EVERYTHING, to the, “Blah Blah province is the best run province”, which has no real evidence or backing anywhere, to scaring people with the “keep X party out of Y province” or scapegoating foreigners for being a burden on our public service. The party does very little to propose any new ideas or a change in methods apart from changing the ‘guy in the chair’, let alone the fact that their stronghold province is crime central, has a high cost of living, prone to service delivery protests, and is literally single-handedly what shoots the country’s inequality coefficient a couple dozen points up. \n</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, you have your earthmoving parties, like the EFF and BLF. Labeled as pro-black, anti-white Marxists, the two are stirring their own pots of wonders. The BLF is infamous for their position on white people, which the EFF CIC was blamed for, but the human rights commission absolved him of hate speech. The common element between the two is what many are calling the populist idea of “black economic empowerment” through expropriating land without compensation. This idea is under constant criticism but the surprising thing is how well this is being received amongst a disillusioned black youth. This approach to some is the absolute worst as it has broken countries like Zimbabwe, but could there be some genuine appeal to it since it is resonating with so many? My only criticism being: is there room for racial rhetoric in our politics since we are building a South Africa that works for all? \n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>The reality of the decision to be made comes back to me every morning and evening when I take a taxi to and from work. I realise, as thousands and thousands of us are bussed to and from our locations, into extremely rich neighborhoods, to work mostly minimum wage jobs, that there is a lot that needs to change. We have done too little in the last 25 years to solve the economy, alleviate poverty and improve the quality of life for an entire subset of our society. And what a lot of the parties seem to be advocating for is a way to sustain a bad situation that is heading towards absolute disaster. Our poverty has reached a point where it has become self-sustaining and this is not a good thing. We have reached a point where crime and other illegal activities are the only means of survival for a very large section of our society and this does not serve us nor the economy well.  \n</p><p><br></p><p>While some pop-up, reactionary, fly by night parties like “The Cows” have come in to offer other alternatives, in my view, they offer too little to the poor. The general consensus within the parties is that we need to increase production, trade and investment to create opportunities. However, a quick look at the Atlantis Green Energy Special Economic Zone, which papers reported that it was under attack from a serious lack of skills, is telling of the poor quality of labour and skills, coupled with a lack of sustainable income, means bad employees and no buyers - and this is a threat to capital, and thereafter, investor confidence declines, even with government deregulation.  \n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>At the end of the day, the honest truth is that any party that is going to fix South Africa has to have a plan to invest directly into the section of the population that the country forgot. There has to be a plan for fixing our locations, adding skills and improving the quality of our domestic product. We need to build a real middle class. The group of society that works and buys. Support for location-based entrepreneurship and development is key to putting money in the hands of more people so that the “markets” can truly be open, and not exclusive.  \n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>Honorable party mentions are GOOD for trying (maybe a little too hard) to be the all-around good guys, and ATA for literally being the only party I have seen campaigning in my location. \n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>The Uhuru Reporter - @capeuhuru</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>08 September 2019 - Jimmy Ramokgopa</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;“95% of economics is common sense”, these were the words of Ha-Joon Chang, a South Korean institutional economist, who specialises in development economics and has contributed to research in the Political Economy of Development at the University of Cambridge. In other words, you don’t have to be an economist to understand economics, but only if you apply your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>After going through the National Treasury's recent document, which highlights a proposed economic strategy for South Africa, I can safely say that a substantial amount of what is in that document sounds right. But, one would wonder, what is “right”? This is a very subjective word, indeed, because what seems to be “right” to a neoliberal such as myself may be completely “wrong” to a communist such as Dr Blade Nzimande. Therefore, from an ideological point of view, the neoliberal will always be “right” in his or her own terms, and similarly, the communist will always be “right” in his or her own terms. But, who is “right-right”? Who do we listen to and why?\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>Ideology, particularly in South Africa, seems to be the only reference upon which all political arguments are based. It’s as if certain political parties argue in a manner which is exclusively aligned to a particular ideology. They discard anything that contradicts their indoctrinated way of thinking, without questioning whether it makes economic sense or not.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>We have seen this many times before. During heated debates about the nationalisation of the land, the arguments are largely based on ideologies from the Freedom Charter and radical socialist regimes. Supporters of nationalisation seldom base their arguments on the actual economics that are relevant to South Africa. We observe similar arguments regarding the NHI - arguments that are based on a particular ideology and reference to Section 27 of the Constitution, which declares access to healthcare services a universal right. This ideology is what drives the political decision, despite having alternative strategies that are based on actual economics.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>This is the illness in South African politics - ideology supersedes common sense, and these ideologies prevent us from collaborating to implement great ideas. If an idea is not aligned to the ideology that has captured a particular group of people, to that particular group, the idea is “wrong”, even if it has the potential to improve the economy of the country. The gateless intellectual prison, referred to as “ideology” in this article, has become a hindrance to the progress and prosperity of our country. This is observed in the reasoning behind the critique of Minister Tito Mboweni’s strategy by some.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>If we agree to consider economics as “glorified common sense”, why are we unable to engage in discourse related to economic matters on the basis of common sense? Should we not be asking ourselves whether Minister Tito Mboweni’s ideas make sense or not, before lambasting them on an ideological position? \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>Does it make sense to reduce certain red-tapes in the banking sector and making it less difficult for individuals to establish and operate commercial banks? I think it does. Does it make sense to reduce VISA regulations strategically, in order to boost tourism? Of course! Does it make sense to make rails and ports more accessible to the private sector, to stimulate trade and job opportunities? I think so. And does it make sense to open the power producing sector to more players, creating jobs in the sector, stabilising the supply and dismantling a monopoly? Absolutely!\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>With the above said, I do accept that we are not a homogenous group and cannot agree completely on all matters relating to the economy, and that is why I am advocating for a “collaborative approach”. Collaboration simply means that we work together towards a common goal, despite our differences. The common goal right now is to save the economy and we must never allow “ideology” to substitute “common sense” in pursuing that goal. Collaboration, guided by logic, reasoning and good ol’ fashioned common sense, is what we need right now.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)</p><p></p>",

What is “economic freedom” and what does it actually mean? A glance through Google might come as a surprise to many, especially those who have associated economic freedom to socialism.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the available literature on “economic freedom” have little or nothing to do with socialism. In fact, it has everything to do with socialism's prime nemesis - liberalism. By definition, economic freedom is one’s ability to participate in the active economy. The freedom is founded on principles of free markets, free trade and private ownership. Basically, one has “economic freedom” when one is able to participate in the active economy without unreasonable restrictions or prohibition of property rights - which is in actual fact, a liberal concept.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>According to the Fraser Institute’s <i>Economic Freedom of the World 2019 Annual Report</i>, economic freedom “is based on the concept of self-ownership. Because of this self-ownership, individuals have a right to choose - to decide how to use their time\n and talents to shape their lives. On the other hand, they do not have a right to the time, talents, and resources of others. Thus, they have no right to take things from others or demand that others provide things for them. The cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, open markets, and clearly defined and enforced property rights.”</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>So why have South Africans adopted a socialist narrative to economic freedom? Rhetoric and slogan politics, that’s why. One would be surprised by the number of people who don’t know what economic freedom means to them. Some will describe it as socialism, or refer to communist principles, ending with a laughable “therefore” statement of what they believe economic freedom is. Of course, everything has its context, and the concept of “economic freedom” has a particular meaning to some, even when it makes no sense at all to those who generally apply their minds.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>I suspect that the call for economic freedom was amplified by the old cliché that “<b>democracy brought political freedom, but not economic freedom.</b>” This statement is actually true, since the majority of people living in poverty do not have access to the active economy, and as a result of that, cannot exercise their “economic freedom” through free trade or private ownership of anything. The <i>Economic Freedom of the World Report</i> also shows that countries that have more “economic freedom” (by liberal standards) are more prosperous, such as New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States of America and Ireland, to name a few. Countries with little or no “economic freedom,'' such as Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Algeria, Sudan, Libya, and, lastly, Venezuela, show fewer signs of prosperity. So, of course, considering our socio-economic situation, it is clear that South Africa is in desperate need of economic freedom, but clearly not the “Malema-nomics” type of economic freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>With the above put into consideration, I think we can all agree that the only reason we find ourselves in this quagmire of poverty, unemployment and hopelessness is that, indeed, economic freedom has not been delivered to the people. But, economic freedom can become actual reality if and only if all citizens of this country have access to the active economy. When citizens are able to trade, leverage assets, and generate wealth for themselves and their families, we will have economic freedom. \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>With that said, in South Africa’s context, we have to start by making the economy more accessible. This needs to be done by undoing the injustices of the past, without compromising the liberal principles that have proven to be successful in the development of prosperous countries. In other words, we need a non-zero-sum-game development of those who do not have access to the economy so that they too can exercise their economic freedom as much as others can. \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)</p><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>29 December 2019 - Jimmy Ramokgopa</p><p><br></p><p>In the great words of Abraham Lincoln, “You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot lift the wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot build character and courage by taking away people's initiative and independence. You cannot help people permanently by doing for them, what they could and should do for themselves.”\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The above mentioned words are very relatable to South Africa. The divide and inequality correlates to a particular racial profile - a racial profile that has been deliberately designed and perpetuated by previous regimes. Of course, I appreciate the logical principle that “correlation is not causation”, but in this case, history would argue that it is. Nonetheless, the focus of this discussion will not be on the blaming of one race for the difficulties of the other. Instead, it will be solution-oriented with the hope of facilitating a conversation upon which all South Africans would find common-ground.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>I think that we can all agree that not all of the issues facing South Africa today are products of Apartheid. Stats SA’s March 2018 report titled <i>Overcoming Poverty and Inequality in South Africa</i> mentions that, despite “extremely high and rising unemployment, skilled labour can be difficult to find in most skilled and professional segments, largely due to the poor state of the public education system.” It also mentions how education has a strong influence on the probability of labour market participation. In addition to that, “Small Micro and Medium Enterprises (SMMEs) have been struggling to advance inclusive growth and development as envisaged in the country’s NDP.” The economic participation of SMMEs has been falling over time as well as the number of employees working in this sector, which is one of the most concerning crises facing the country today, apart from Eskom.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>How do we fix the country? \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>Primarily, there are two schools of thought. One believes that the only way to fix South Africa is through restoration and redistribution; the other believes that it is through economic growth only. The former then argues that there cannot be economic growth without redistribution. The latter then says that there cannot be any redistribution if there is nothing to distribute [i.e. if there is no economic growth].<b> Indeed, it is true that if you eat the wealthy, it will be your last meal. But what choice does one have when there is nothing else to eat?\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is that both schools of thought are correct. Considering our past, there needs to be some form of restoration and redistribution. It is not by coincidence that certain groups find themselves in poverty - in their majority. They don’t just <i>happen </i>to be poor. There was a deliberate effort to position them that way, and so, there has to be a deliberate effort to emancipate them. At the same time, the emancipation of those who have been wronged cannot be at the expense of the economy. If that happens, then indeed, it shall be our last meal.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>However, if we agree that something has to be done about the inequality and, at the same time, agree that this should not happen at the expense of the economy, then perhaps “redistribution” is not the correct term to use. I would suggest that, to change our perspective, we talk about “development” instead of “redistribution”. “Redistribution” implies the loss from a particular group, whilst “development” describes the gain of a particular group without the loss from the other. “Development” describes what a non-zero-sum game is, and I believe that <i>that </i>is the approach that is needed in South Africa right now.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>A non-zero-sum approach would be the implementation of policy that develops “previously disadvantaged groups” without taking anything from existing businesses. For example, instead of taking shares from an existing business and giving them to a black individual, one would rather incentivise the business for doing business with other black businesses; or incentivise businesses for contributing to the training and development of black people. \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>Many of these principles are present in the updated version of B-BBEE, where the focus is more on development rather than the transfer of ownership. Even though B-BBEE has a lot of room for improvement, I believe that a paradigm shift from “redistribution” to “development” is what will help fix South Africa. This is a more sustainable solution because “development” is permanent and transferable to other generations. You cannot “un-develop” a person. This is why white South Africans are generally able to sustain themselves even after the Apartheid regime - it is because development is transferable.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>This type of development would allow black people to learn and grow for themselves without relying on being given ownership of existing businesses. As Abraham Lincoln would say, you cannot help people permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. And as I would say, it is within everyone’s best interest to develop those who have not been developed yet, before they decide to have their last meal. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)</p><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>12 January &nbsp;2020 - Jimmy Ramokgopa</p><p><br></p><p>“We strive for the best we can attain within the scope the world allows.” These are the words of John Rawls, in his book titled “Political Liberalism”. Indeed, from a practical point of view, we are limited to the scope that our world permits. Of course, it is good to dream and it is better to have an <i>internal locus of control</i>, but the reality is that, even when it is possible to be the best at what we do, all is determined by the circumstances around you.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Richard J. Arneson, in an article published in the Journal of Political Philosophy, titled “Equality of Opportunity for Welfare Defended and Recanted” (1999), mentions that the “more difficult and painful it is for an individual to make [the] best choice, the less reasonable it is to expect that she will make that choice. In other words, people have equal opportunity for welfare when the cards they are dealt are such that if they play their cards as well as one could expect, they gain the same expected welfare”. In simpler terms, it is reasonable to expect better results from people who have access to better resources than from those who do not.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>“Fairness” can be a rather subjective matter and may seem mythical in many instances. “Fairness” means different things to different people under different circumstances. Google defines it as “impartial and just treatment or behaviour without favouritism or discrimination.” The definition makes sense, but is limited to human interaction. It says nothing about the intrinsic and extrinsic circumstances of the human being in relation to fairness.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Free market principles make reference to concepts of “fair competition,” where businesses operate on a “level” playing field. This is obviously mythical, since there are no identical businesses, with identical assets, opportunities and resources. Despite attempts from regulatory bodies to enforce “fair competition,” it is only natural for businesses to maximise their utility, which often results in competitors experiencing a loss.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In the political sense, many would say that “equality” is “fairness.” They would also argue that this article contradicts itself by saying that “equality” is a myth and yet claims that “fairness” isn’t. Of course, superficially, that argument would make perfect sense. But if you analyse the two concepts closely, you will realise that they are different and that one has had many occurrences, whilst the other has occurred only once since the beginning of time.</p><p><br></p><p>  \n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When has “equality” ever occurred?</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Equality is defined as “the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities.” Therefore, equality among human beings occurred at least 2.8 million years ago, soon after they had evolved and became the first members of the human species, called Homo habilis. During that period of time, the first human beings were on an equal footing, and thereafter, equality became virtually impossible. This was due to the fact that some could run faster than others, make better tools than others, and build better shelters than others.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When has “fairness” ever occurred?</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Fairness occurs many times. In the olympics, all athletes start on the same line. In a soccer match, all teams start with the same number of players. That is fair. But as mentioned earlier, “fairness” is not “equality.” Starting on the same line during a race, or having the same number of players on a soccer field, doesn’t mean that equality exists. Some athletes are simply stronger than others; some are more talented. Thus, “equality” becomes a myth.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>So, even if we were to reset the economy, and provide every human being the same amount of resources, inequality would be an inevitable feature of the future. However, with that said, the issue facing South Africa is that the previous regime created an unfair socio-economic system. In the new dispensation, we did not start on the same line. We did not start with the same number of players. That is unfair.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>So, how do we fix this? How do we make an ongoing and inevitably unequal system fair? Well, there are three possible options:\n</p><p>1) You reset the system, placing everyone on the same starting position. However, because of the finite resources, I suspect that this would lead to extreme poverty.\n</p><p>2) You restrict the progress of those who are ahead - through policy and taxation. I believe this is what many African countries have been trying to do, which has actually limited economic growth altogether by making it difficult for the generation of new opportunities. \n</p><p>3) You accelerate those who have been left behind through developmental policy, until they find themselves in a position that would allow them to compete fairly.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>I’m an advocate of the third option. To me, it makes better sense to develop than to take from others. Afterall, you cannot develop the poor by bringing the wealthy down.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)</p><p></p>",

          "text": "<p>10 February &nbsp;2020 - Jimmy Ramokgopa</p><p><br></p><p>“Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies.” These were the words of Julius Henry \"Groucho\" Marx, an American comedian of the 1900’s, who seems to have had the best description of what we are witnessing in today’s political landscape.\n</p><p><br></p><p>It’s rather canny that I decided to introduce this article with a quote from a comedian, and one would argue that it’s quite appropriate too, considering the comedy of political options we have in this diverse and wonderful country of ours [South Africa].\n</p><p><br></p><p>The interim leader of the Democratic Alliance, John Steenhuisen, has made his position clear on issues of race-based policies, citing that the use of race as a proxy for disadvantage has done nothing but create a minority of black elites. His statement is riddled with inaccuracies, but true in some instances. Unsurprisingly, as described by Groucho Marx in the intro of this article, he looked for trouble, found it, but diagnosed it incorrectly. It would then follow that he is likely to apply the wrong remedies, should he find himself in the unlikely event of being the President of this country.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The problem with John Steenhuisen’s remarks is that, even though he is correct in saying that BEE has failed to include many black South Africans in the active economy, he is ignoring is the fact that (i) BEE did not work because of white-collar corruption, and (ii) the fact that BEE did not work does <b><i>not </i></b>negate the need for race-based policy.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>John also argues that redress is still of a need to South Africa, based on our unfortunate past, but prefers that “poverty” be the only point of consideration. The greatest issue with this is that John believes that the economic emancipation of black people is a mere concept of job creation. He ignores the fact that many white South Africans enjoy the proceeds of Apartheid’s economic development, which went beyond the creation of jobs for white people. In John’s mind, the legacy of Apartheid has no bearing on the economic access that is based on race. To him, we should rather continue as if people weren’t excluded from being industry leaders based on the colour of their skin.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>It should be obvious to the Democratic Alliance that when a particular group is deliberately excluded from developmental opportunities, to correct that, one needs to take deliberate steps. One cannot simply wash it off as if nothing happened. “Correcting” the injustices of the past by merely doing what any decent government ought to do anyway (that is, to grow the economy and create more jobs) has to be the most laughable act of John’s political comedy. Of course, as a government, you have to create jobs for the poor. But what about the economic imbalance that is undoubtedly based on race? What about redress?</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In Singapore, women were once excluded from the economy. They were not allowed to own property and were pushed to more “nurturing professions,” whilst men occupied the more technical and business professions. It was only until 2007 that marital rape became legally recognized. It was then criminalised under the Criminal Law Reform Act passed on 6 May 2019. Merital rape is the act of sexual intercouse with a person’s spouce, without the concent of the spouce - a symbol of the sexism and patriarchy that created the economic imbalance between women and men in Singapore. Even after the adoption of the Women’s Charter of 1961, which advocated for women’s rights, Singapore “has high or extremely high gender inequality” according to the British Chamber of Commerce (Singapore, 2018). This is because Singapore does not have actual laws that advocate for gender equality.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Unlike Singapore, Sweden has taken deliberate steps to correct the injustices of the past. On the Swedish official website, it is clearly stated that “Gender discrimination in the workplace has been illegal since 1980.” The Swedish Discrimination Act of 2009 demands that employers actively promote equality between men and women. Even with the progress that has been made thus far, Sweden is currently considering the implementation quotas in their policies to fast-track the correction of past injustices. Sweden’s Gender Equality index sits at 83.6, whilst Singapore’s is at 68 - it shouldn’t be surprising that Sweden has a better gender equality position compared to Singapore.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Historically, imbalances and inequalities have been caused by sexism and/or racism. John Steenhuisen needs to recognise that, without actual and deliberate steps of correcting past injustices, not much of the status quo will change. And even if we manage to grow the economy and create more jobs, like Singapore, we will continue to have inequality that reflects the injustices of the past. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)</p><p></p>",

It was wrong, but it was not a crime, he says.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Without considering De Klerk’s denial of Apartheid being a crime, the fact that even De Klerk himself recognises that Apartheid was an unjust system, means that we have to ask ourselves “what then?”</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>If we accept Apartheid as an unjust system, where the black majority were excluded from the economy, what do we then do about it? Do we pretend as if nothing happened and let things be? Or do we actually do something to attend to the specific injustices of Apartheid?</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In general, the governing ANC and the official opposition party believe that there should be some sort of redress, following an era of systematic descrimination and marginalisation. However, they differ in the way in which redress should be implemented.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>In the global scheme of things, there are actually two main ideologies in the South African political landscape: that is, collectivism and individualism. The centre-right and classical liberals of South Africa are advocates of individualism. They believe in individual rights. They believe that people should be judged as individuals, and in order to do so, policies that group people, such as black empowerment policies, need to be eradicated. These are the likes of Gwen Ngwenya, John Steenhuisen, Helen Zille, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>On the other hand, the centre-left and socialists of South Africa are advocates of collectivism. They believe that people should be judged according to the collective circumstances of the particular group which they identify themselves with. These are the likes of ANC policy makers.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Both the collectivists and the individualists are correct in the reasons behind their positions. The individualists argue that collectivist policies have brought nothing but the creation of a minority group of black elites and has further contributed to the inequality gap of South Africa.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This is true. However, the collectivists are also correct in pointing out that the inequality that is present in the first place is a result of the Apartheid regime. They are also correct in saying that if nothing is done to attend to the racial based inequality, it will persist indefinitely. This argument has been exhausted throughout the world, and through many studies, it has been proven to be correct.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>The United States of America had Affirmative Action meant to address previous injustices. European countries have also had redress policies, particularly to attend to gender inequality. Like racial inequality, gender inequality is a product of descrimination and marginalisation. In a February 2020 Politricks SA article, Singapore was compared to Sweden, where it was noted that Sweden had actual gender-based laws which resulted in a significantly higher gender equality index. Unsurprisingly, Singapore does not have any gender-based laws. This proved that in order to address an actual injustice, you have to pass an actual policy.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>So, why do we need race-based policies in South Africa?\n</p><p>Well, because history happened.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The proportional inequality of South Africa is a product of racial descrimination. And of course, the individualists will argue that race is not a proxy of inequality, but the statistics show that the average black person is at a worse position than the average white or indian person. And yes, this is a generalisation. It’s a general statement. Of course, not all black people are poor and not all white people are well off. But because you cannot have 50 million policies for 50 million individuals, such a generalisation is important and is in fact scientifically acceptable.</p><p><br></p><p> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>But, with that said, I think we can all agree that policies like BEE did not work, but that does not negate the need for policy that considers race. I’ll admit that it’s not easy, but with a little bit of thought, at least some sensible policies can be developed.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Thank you for listening and getting this far. Let me know what you think. See you again next time. \n</p><p>\n</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy Ramokgopa (@JimmyRamokgopa)</p><p></p>",
